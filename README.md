# Module-8

  This project was designed to mimic the actions of a clock by having the user increase the time by adding seconds, minutes, and/or hours and displays the time in a text display. The program works as intended and I’m proud with how I did the time display but, while this project was meant to be a test I would like to improve this code to become a functional clock that either keeps time or retrieves time-data from another source to make sure the display time is 100% accurate. The good news is that because I commented my code thoroughly, adjusting and adapting it for future projects shouldn’t be too much of an issue.

  Other than adding functionality to this program I could make improvements through the removal of the global variables. I now know there are many reasons to avoid global variables. One of these reasons is that it makes them hard to trace. This can cause errors in other parts of the program when a local change is made. This makes updating the software difficult and make it more likely to become obsolete. While this program wasn’t too difficult had I encountered issues I know I could use websites like Quora or Stackoverflow to see if anyone else had a similar problem before and use what they did to solve my problem. Moving on to future programs I plan on no longer using global variables and being diligent with code comments.
